# GTA-Solo-Lobby-Maker

This application will open up a Public lobby in GTA V.
It only manages the resources given to the process of GTAV.exe   it wont affect the data so it cant be considerd hacking.
To make a single lobby  just go into a Public lobby in GTA V and run the application.  
When its finished it shows that everyone left the server except for you, but you are the one who switched the lobby  so no one will know :)

This project uses the psutil library.


If you have any questions feel free to ask me.
